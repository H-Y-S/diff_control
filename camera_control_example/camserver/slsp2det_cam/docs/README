Where some bits are located

========================================================
slsp2det_cam/utils/test5 does several things:

1) Generates the XOR table according to the declared parameters and 
checks certain values.

2) Does a timing test.

3) Decodes and analyzes raw (serial) images - you must modify it to
track the particular problem you are debugging.

4) Generates the "de-trim" function for the P2 chips.

5) Optionally generates the text version of the XOR table (43 MByte for 20
bits) - but, you have to turn it on in the code.

=========================================================

slsp2det_cam/gstar/gsd.ko - the PMC GigaSTaR kernel module

=========================================================

slsp2det_cam/gstar/gst - the test program and library for the 
PMC GigaSTaR kernel module

=========================================================

slsp2det_cam/gstar/dcblib - the library for the DCB; also dcbt, the
test program for the DCB

=========================================================

High performance kernel modifications:

For the large DMA allocations needed for >3 banks (15 modules), see notes
in dcb.h

To increase process priority without being root, see notes in interface.c

For the PMC GigaSTaR driver module timer to work correctly, CPU frequency
scaling should be turned off (see note in gslib.c).

For highest throughput with multi-module detectors, I make a stripped-down
OS configuration in /etc/rc.d/rc4.d - i.e., runlevel 4.  This has only a
minimal number of services running.  The single module detectors do not seem
to need this.

I have been using kernels patched with Ingo Molnar's real-time patches
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/
I have observed some crashes with these, however. Further, the unpatched 
2.6.19 real-time kernels seem to perform almost as well.
