The gigastar source codes and test modules are here.

The gigastar driver module defines a filesystem called 'gfs' which is
the inteface between programs and the driver.  This filesystem is
mounted on '/home/det/gstar/gsdev' by convention.

ls /home/det/gstar/gsdev     gives:
gs0  time

ls /home/det/gstar/gsdev/gs0      gives:
BAR0  BAR1  read0  read1  write0  write1

cat /home/det/gstar/gsdev/time     gives(e.g.):
CMOS: Tue 2005/Oct/20 12:36:29

All other files must be accessed through programs for a meaningful result.

See the gigstar driver and library documentation for details.

************************************************************************
The PMC-GigaSTaR card driver is located in, e.g., src/gs_drv-1.8, and
is linked to 'gsd' in the base directory.

The driver is a free-standing program.  You can do 'make tar' in the
driver directory, and have a portable '.tgz' file that can be placed at
any point in the directory tree.

A test program for the driver + card is in e.g., src/gst-2.2, and is
linked to 'gst' in the base directory.  This program depends on 'gsdc.h',
which is in the driver directory, and on xor_tab.o provided in 
camserver/slsp2det/util.

The 'gst' directory implements the gigstar library, gslib.o, that is
used in other programs, such as dcbt, and in the dcb library.

The 'gstar' directory implements the dcb library, 'dcblib.o', used by
the dcb readout routines, and also a test program, dcbt.  This program
depends on the slsp2det tree.

The directory /home/det/gstar has links to the gsd and gst directories in
the tvx tree.  Thus, there is only copy of these routines in the system.

By convention, /home/det/gstar/gsd is linked to, e.g., 
/home/det/p2det/programs/tvx/camera/camserver/slsp2det/gstar/gsd, and
thus the driver can be loaded from /home/det/gstar/gsd.
