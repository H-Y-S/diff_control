These directories contain the sources for the gigstar driver module and
the gigastar test program.  They are stand-alone: they could be moved
or copied to any location.

The header files and library are needed by the main program in the TVX
environment, and are accessed there by links.  Only here are the true sources.

The Makefile here is only for use in the standalone setup, except for
the target 'standalone':  in the TVX environment, 'make standalone' will 
make a standalone gsd_gst.tgz file in the user's home directory.  This 
file should be unzipped into a suitable directory, then 'make' issued 
in that directory.  E.g.:

cd
mkdir gst_standalone
cd gst_standalone
tar -zxf ../gsd_gst.tgz
make

To use the standalone setup, you will need the following directory
on which to mount the gigastar driver:

mkdir -p ~/gstar/gsdev

See gsd/gsd_load.sh and gsd/README for more information.
