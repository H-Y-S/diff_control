tvxpkg.c - remove set, etc.

FIXME:
progi2c/i2c_util.c
util/interface.c
tvxpkg.c


rdImgB &  rdImgM functionality - also docs

Pwait functionality

SetNImages & procedure - get overlap of expose & reading

in dcblib.c:~336 - we should look for kill key
we should also process commands so that a typed stop can work

How do we do a plain readout?

selpix x y   -- implement calpix
fillpix val  -- becomes rbd

trim stuff

fillpixels - only operates on selected chips??

fillpix & calibrate - can these be done on modules in parallel?
