# slsp2det_cam/include/camera_casedefs.txt
# optionally hard-code part or all of the case values in camserver
# this file is used by mkheader

# the name of this file is the base name of the program (e.g., camserver)
#      with "_casedefs.txt" appended
# this file is located in the camera-specific include directory

# some rules apply:
# the cases must occur in the same order as in your tvxcampkg.c
# the comparison is case sensitive
# the numeric values you assign must be monotonically increasing
# the lowest value you assign should be larger than the largest automatic
#      assignment - say, 200
# there can be gaps in the numeric sequence reserved for future expansion
# unassigned cases occuring after your assigned cases will be automatically
#      assigned sequentially by the compiler after your last assigned case; 
#      hence you need only assign the first case to obtain your own 
#      private sequence
# the numbers can be decimal or hex
# formatting can be with tabs or spaces
# cases listed here, but not in tvxcampkg.c, are ignored, but remain available
#      for later use.

# the easiest way to get your initial list is to copy out of camserver.h
