Fixed the base-level command values to facilitate independent developments.

          CamCmd =   1,
        CamSetup =   2,
         CamWait =   3,
        DataPath =   4,
              Df =   5,
          ExpEnd =   6,
        Exposure =   7,
         ExpTime =   8,
    HeaderString =   9,
         ImgPath =  10,
      LdCmndFile =  11,
      Read_setup =  12,
               K =  13,
        ResetCam =  14,
            Send =  15,
         ShowPID =  16,
   ShutterEnable =  17,
       TelemetrY =  18,
            ExiT =  19,
            QuiT =  20,
            MenU =  21,
		  Status =  22,
	   CamStatus =  23,

(Camera-specific commands not (yet) fixed)

See, e.g., slsp2det_cam/include/camera_casedefs.txt for the file that is
actually incorporated during 'make'.
